# Face Mask Detection Using YOLOv5

This project implements a face mask detection system using YOLOv5. It utilizes the Kaggle dataset for face mask detection and provides a streamlined process for training, testing, and inference. 

---

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle:  
[**Face Mask Detection Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection/data)  

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. **Prepare the Dataset**
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle.
2. Create a folder structure for organizing the dataset:
   ```
   kaggle/
   â”œâ”€â”€ input/
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ face-mask-detection/
   â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ images/
   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ annotations/
   â””â”€â”€ working/
   ```
3. Copy the `images` and `annotations` folders into `kaggle/input/face-mask-detection/`.

### 2. **Google Drive Setup**
1. Upload the complete `kaggle` folder to your Google Drive.
2. Upload the following to your Google Drive:
   - **YOLOv5 Weights Folder**: Pretrained weights for YOLOv5.
   - **YOLOv5 Repository**: If you don't want to re-install YOLOv5.

### 3. **Install YOLOv5**
If you donâ€™t have YOLOv5 installed:
```bash
!git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5
%cd yolov5
!pip install -qr requirements.txt
```

### 4. **Source Code**
Upload the source code to Google Drive and run all necessary cells in your notebook.

---

## Execution

1. **Run the Notebook**: Execute all cells in the notebook for training and detection.
2. **Python Version**: Ensure Python 3.10 is installed and used.
3. **Results**:  
   Outputs for each run will be stored in the `yolov5/runs/detect/` directory.

---

## Outputs and Results

- All detection results (images or videos with detected face masks) are saved in `yolov5/runs/detect/`.
- Models trained with this project can be reused or fine-tuned with updated datasets.
